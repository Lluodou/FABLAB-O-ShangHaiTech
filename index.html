<h1>Self intruduction</h1>

<p>Hi, I&#39;m 孙震寰 (Sun ZhenHuan), a student in ShanghaiTech University. This website is used to record what I learned in &quot;FABO academic X&quot;.</p>

<h1>My Works</h1>

<h2>Lasercut</h2>

<p>The goal of this assignment is to design and make some parts of splicing toy. </p>

<h3>Design</h3>

<p>The first step is to design it. First, we design a part that have many slots, which means this part is used to be a connector, connecting other parts together.
First, we draw a large circle, then we draw a slot, then we copy it, and rotate it for 45°, then we choose two slots, and rotate it for 90°, and choose four slots and rotate it for 180°. Finally, we have 8 slots.
After that, we can use tool in Fusion to make the edge of slots be round. And also, we can draw a litter circle in center to let this part have a small hole.

Another part is a 90° corner. The way to design it is similar to design the first part. But one important thing is, must make sure the slots in both parts are identical (at least, slots should have same width).

<h3>From Fusion to CorelDraw</h3>

<p>After finish design, we should save drafts in Fusion 360 as .dxf file. Right click on the draft and choose “save as .dxf”. Then we get .dxf file which can be used for laser cutting.

<h3>About Laset cutting</h3>

<p>When I use laser cuter, the machine didn’t work well, which means I have to use more powerful parameters to cut the wooden board. This time, I use power 90 and speed 3.0.</p>

<h3>Final result</h3>

<p>Pictures below is what I finally made.

<h2>3D Printing</h2>

<p>The goal of this assignment is to make an object that can&#39;t be make by Lasercut.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>

<p>Usually, three-dimensional object like cylinder and cone can&#39;t be make by Lasercut.
I like playing &quot;Kerbal Space program&quot;<img alt="Pricture6" title="Picture6" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lluodou/Lluodou.github.io/master/Assignment2/KSP.jpg"/>so I decide to make an engine of this game.
First, Open &quot;Kerbal Space program&quot;, and observe the shape of the engine. (I choose &quot;MainSail&quot; Engine, because it is one of the most useful engine in the game.)
<img alt="Pricture7" title="Picture7" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lluodou/Lluodou.github.io/master/Assignment2/MainSail.jpg"/>
The rough shape of the engine is two cone that partly overlap. So we first create an sectional view of the engine.</p>
